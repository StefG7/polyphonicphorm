# Poly(phonic)Phorm: Visualizing Audio Embeddings in 3D with Physarum Simulation

### What if you had the power to hold songs in the palm of your hand?

Through the integration of various existing projects, you can interactively visualize music in a 3D space to depict overall song patterns. Not only that, this opens the possibilty to printing song patterns as tangible items that fit in your hand!
Here you will find supporting song data files and source code that make up this project.

This link is a blog post by Applied Math PhD student, Michael Lin, that includes all the source code and instructions for running audio encoders. He also provides pictures and a YouTube video explaining this method further.

Polyphorm Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02441
This paper goes into detail about Polyphorm being a tool for interactive visualization and data reconstruction for cosmological datasets. This gives us an idea of how we would like to visualize our 3D forms of music, by applying other song-related datasets.
